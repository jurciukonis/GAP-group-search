# Database of discrete groups of order O ≤ 2000
This is a scan through the [SmallGroups](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/smallgrp.html) library of all the finite groups of order smaller than 2001 to identify the groups that possess at least one faithful dimensional irreducible representation and that cannot be written as the direct product of a smaller group times a cyclic group. We identify the center $Z_N$ of each of those groups, and also the dimensions $D$ of their faithful irreducible representations.

- Groups of orders 512, 1024, and 1536 are not displayed in database.

- We have obtained 87,349 non-isomorphic groups, that are all listed in our tables available in files "database/groups.xlsx" and "database/groups.ods".

- Some [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) inpute codes are available in folder "src".

- For more information about the centers and computation methods see ref. [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12133)]. For more information on each discrete subgroup of U(3) and SU(3) see ref. [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00005)].
