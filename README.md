# GAP-group-search
Scan through the SmallGroups library of all the finite groups of order smaller than 2 001 to identifying the groups that possess a faithful dimensional irreducible representation and cannot be written as the direct product of a smaller group times a cyclic group.
Groups of orders 512, 1024, and 1536 are not displayed in database.
