# Database of discrete groups of order O ≤ 2000
Scan through the SmallGroups library of all the finite groups of order smaller than 2 001 to identifying the groups that possess a faithful dimensional irreducible representation and cannot be written as the direct product of a smaller group times a cyclic group.		

- We identify the center $Z_N$ of each of those groups, and also the dimensions $D$ of their faithful irreducible representations.

- Groups of orders 512, 1024, and 1536 are not displayed in database.

- We have thus obtained 87,349 non-isomorphic groups, that are all listed in our tables available in files "database/groups.xlsx" and "database/groups.ods".

- Some GAP source codes available in folder "src".

- For more information about centers and computation methods see ref. [1]. For more information on each discrete subgroups of U(3) and SU(3) see ref. [2].
